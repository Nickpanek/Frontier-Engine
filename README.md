🤠 About The Project

The Frontier Engine is a proprietary generative music engine designed to automate the composition of "Neo-Western," "Dark Country," and "Delta Blues" music. Unlike standard MIDI tools which are restricted to discrete notes, this engine utilizes Slide Calculus to mathematically simulate the microtonal pitch-gliding of a bottleneck slide guitar.

This repository serves as the immutable timestamp and proof of ownership for the source code, the generative algorithms, and the resulting asset library.
🛠️ Technical Architecture

The engine functions as a "Virtual Slide Guitarist" executing a deterministic score:

    Slide Calculus: Applies a trigonometric sine-wave function to the MIDI Pitch Wheel (sin(π * t)) to create continuous pitch geometry, simulating the physics of a glass slide.

    The "Devil's Scale": Strictly enforces the Minor Blues Pentatonic scale with the inclusion of the Tritone (Flat 5) for harmonic tension.

    Stomp Logic: Prioritizes low-frequency percussion on downbeats to simulate the "Boot Stomp" rhythm characteristic of the genre.

📦 The Asset Library

This repository contains the "Panek Blues Collection", a verified library of unique musical compositions generated by this engine.

    Manifest: Panek_Blues_Manifest.csv (Internal to the zip archive).

    Archive: NickPanek_Blues_Collection.zip (The complete collection of MIDI assets).
